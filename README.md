+ Project summary: In this project, we developed a new method (Image Transpose + Modified Feature + XGBoost) and improved the classification accuracy for images of emotions on faces to .73 AUC and 88% Accuracy. 

	
**Contribution statement**: "S" created the KNN Model, Created PPT slides, orginized the code (comments), tried to update Baseline, apprized the group of the main target points of the project. "H" ceated the XGBoost Model (final model), Modified Features to be added to the Models and Updated PPT Slides, Presented, helped in understanding the cross validation code, cross validated. "M" created the CNN, Updated the Baseline Model (gbm), orginized the main.rmd code, compiled the data, helped in understanding the baseline code, cross validated, wrote the testing script for presentation day. "ZC" created the Image transpose code to be added to the most of the Models. "ZK" created SVM Model. "J" worked on the LDA model.
